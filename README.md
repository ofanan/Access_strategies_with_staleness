This project provides simulator tools to test several access strategies for network caching where the information about the cached content may be stale. 

The project is based on the paper:

I. Cohen, Gil Einziger, R. Friedman, and G. Scalosub, "Access Strategies for Network Caching", IEEE Infocom 2019, pp.28-36.
