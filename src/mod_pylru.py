# The cache is implemented using a combination of a python dictionary (hash
# table) and a circular doubly linked list. Items in the cache are stored in
# nodes. These nodes make up the linked list. The list is used to efficiently
# maintain the order that the items have been used in. The front or head of
# the list contains the most recently used item, the tail of the list
# contains the least recently used item. When an item is used it can easily
# (in a constant amount of time) be moved to the front of the list, thus
# updating its position in the ordering. These nodes are also placed in the
# hash table under their associated key. The hash table allows efficient
# lookup of values by key.
